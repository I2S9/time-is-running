> **A confrontational time-management app** that makes procrastination physically painful (metaphorically).  
Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and a disregard for subtlety.

## 🚀 Features  

### Time Shock Therapy  
- **Mortality Countdown**: "You have X weeks left" calculated from life expectancy data.  
- **Exploding Deadlines**: Tasks visually escalate when nearing due dates.  
- **Procrastination Amplifier**: Tracks wasted time and displays it in Playfull Daily font (for science).  

### Unapologetic Design  
- **Oversized UI**: Clocks, buttons, and progress bars you can’t ignore.  
- **Brutalist Typography**: Because Helvetica doesn’t scream "YOUR TIME IS LIMITED".  
- **Light Mode Default**: You’re confronting mortality—light mode is forbidden.  

### Technical Highlights  
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS for aggressively large UI components  
- Framer Motion for dramatic micro-interactions  
- Clerk for auth (optional shame-sharing with friends)
